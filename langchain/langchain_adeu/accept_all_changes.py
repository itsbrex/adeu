"""Accept all tracked changes in a .docx file, producing a finalized clean copy.

Wraps `adeu.RedlineEngine.accept_all_revisions`. Use this when a document
review is fully complete and every pending insertion, deletion, and
formatting change should be incorporated as final text. For selective
acceptance of specific changes, use `AdeuApplyChanges` with `accept`
actions targeting individual change IDs.

This tool is destructive in the sense that, in the output document, no
tracked-change history remains. The input document is left untouched.
