# Project Context: Adeu

## System Overview
Adeu acts as a "Virtual DOM" for DOCX files, enabling LLMs to edit documents via a text proxy while preserving complex XML structure.
- **Ingestion**: `ingest.py` creates a Markdown/CriticMarkup representation of the document.
- **Mapping**: `mapper.py` builds a linear index of text spans linking back to `python-docx` objects.
- **Reconciliation**: `engine.py` calculates and applies atomic XML patches (`w:ins`/`w:del`).
- **Agent Interface**: `server.py` exposes these capabilities as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, while `cli.py` handles automated environment configuration.

## Architectural Decisions & Invariants

### 1. Ingestion & Formatting
*   **Newline Isolation**: Markdown formatting markers (`**`, `_`, etc.) **must never** enclose newline characters (`\n`).
    *   *Reasoning*: Wrapping newlines breaks many Markdown parsers and complicates line-based text segmentation.
    *   *Implementation*: `utils.docx.apply_formatting_to_segments` splits text by newlines *before* wrapping segments in markers.
    *   *Pattern*: `**Line 1**\n**Line 2**`, NOT `**Line 1\nLine 2**`.
*   **Multi-Level Lists**: OOXML `<w:ilvl>` maps natively to standard Markdown indentation (4 spaces per level) on read. On write, the engine parses leading spaces divided by 4 to explicitly inject `<w:ilvl>` into `<w:numPr>`.

### 2. XML Normalization & Surgical Mode
*   **Surgical Mode**: The `RedlineEngine` operates in "Surgical Mode" — it never performs global document normalization (`normalize_docx`) on initialization or save. It strictly preserves untouched paragraphs, preventing the silent destruction of unrelated metadata (like `<w:proofErr>`) and preserving exact XML whitespace lines to guarantee minimal, readable diffs.
*   **Run Coalescing**: We merge adjacent runs with identical styling to reduce token count and simplify mapping ("Con" + "tract" -> "Contract").
*   **Safety Constraint**: Runs containing "Special Content" (`w:br`, `w:tab`, `w:commentReference`, `w:drawing`) are **immutable boundaries**.
    *   *Rule*: Never merge a run containing special tags into a text run, or the special tag will be destroyed.
    *   *Deletion Survival*: When a text run containing Special Content is marked for deletion (`w:del`), the engine uses `deepcopy` to clone the run. This ensures images and structural elements physically survive inside the deletion block instead of being silently erased.

### 3. The "Virtual Text" Contract
*   `ingest.py` and `mapper.py` must be strictly synchronized.
*   If `ingest.py` produces virtual characters (e.g., `{==` or `**`), `mapper.py` must explicitly account for them as `virtual` spans so the `RedlineEngine` knows they do not exist in the DOM.

### 4. Agentic Distribution Strategy & Monorepo
*   **Dual Engine Architecture**: Adeu maintains parallel backends in Python (FastMCP, rich CLI) and TypeScript/Node.js (`@adeu/core`, `@adeu/mcp-server`).
*   **Native Desktop Extension (MCPB)**: We ship a fully self-contained Node.js backend bundled as a zero-dependency `index.js` for Claude Desktop extensions. This eliminates Python/`uvx` environment constraints for end-users. The 1.2MB bundle is ignored in `.gitignore`, built entirely via CI/CD, and distributed via NPM and GitHub Releases to avoid repository bloat.
*   **Auto-Configuration**: The Python CLI `adeu init` command still manages local dev injections into `claude_desktop_config.json`.
    *   *Safety*: It must always create a timestamped backup (`.bak`) before modifying the user's config.
    *   *OS Agnostic*: It handles path resolution for Windows (`%APPDATA%`) and macOS (`~/Library`) automatically.
*   **Smithery Marketplace Publishing**: To bypass the "Schema Deadlock" (Anthropic's `mcpb pack` rejects tool schemas, but Smithery's registry requires them), we use a dynamic patch strategy. `scripts/patch_smithery_mcpb.py` boots the compiled Node server, extracts live schemas via JSON-RPC (`tools/list`), and injects them into the packaged `.mcpb` manifest before publishing.

### 5. Block-Level Parsing & Tables
*   **Sequential Iteration**: We iterate over document elements (`w:p` and `w:tbl`) in strict XML order using `iter_block_items`. We do *not* iterate `part.paragraphs` and `part.tables` separately, as this destroys document flow (e.g., tables appearing after all text).
*   **Recursion**: Ingestion and Mapping are recursive. `Document` -> `Table` -> `Cell` -> `Block Items` -> ...
*   **Synchronization Invariants**:
    *   **Empty Rows**: `ingest.py` must *never* skip empty table rows. `mapper.py` iterates all rows in the DOM; skipping one in text extraction causes index misalignment.
    *   **Deleted Rows (Clean View)**: To simulate the "Accepted" document state (`clean_view=True`), the extraction pipelines explicitly skip table rows that contain a `<w:del>` tag inside their `<w:trPr>` properties.
    *   **Separators**: Row separators (`\n`) are injected *between* rows. Virtual pipes (` | `) separate cells.
    *   **Cell Isolation**: The virtual `|` boundary represents a hard `<w:tc>` cell wall. Modifying text across `|` boundaries is dynamically segmented into per-cell edits by the engine. Structural table changes (adding or removing rows, or adding/removing `|` columns) via text replacement are explicitly intercepted and strictly rejected to prevent gridspan corruption and misaligned `<w:tc>` elements.
    *   **Heuristic Cell Matching**: When modifying table rows via text substitution, we explicitly `.strip()` individual cell contents to bypass whitespace drift and accurately anchor comments to the semantically modified cell.
    *   **Structural Table Safety**: Table row manipulation is strictly enforced via intent-based API models (`InsertTableRow`, `DeleteTableRow`) to safely manipulate the DOM without risking gridspan corruption. *(Note: Currently supported for disk-based DOCX editing only; gracefully intercepted and rejected in Live Word COM)*.

### 6. The Unified `DocumentChange` API
*   **Flat API Structure**: The LLM interacts with a flat list of `DocumentChange` objects (Discriminated Union of `ModifyText`, `AcceptChange`, `RejectChange`, `ReplyComment`, `InsertTableRow`, `DeleteTableRow`).
*   **Search & Replace First**: Pure insertions and deletions are intentionally hidden from the LLM. All text modifications must be executed as search-and-replace (`ModifyText`) to guarantee sufficient anchoring context for the fuzzy matcher.
*   **Universal Tooling**: Disk-based and Live Word tools share the same endpoints (`read_docx`, `process_document_batch`). On Windows, omitting file paths dynamically routes the command to the active Live Word COM object, preventing LLM tool selection paralysis.
*   **Heading Depth Validation**: Markdown heading depths (`#`) are strictly clamped to a maximum of 6. Exceeding this raises a `BatchValidationError` to prevent the silent generation of broken/unstyled XML blocks.
*   **Strict Action Validation**: The batch engine strictly enforces referential integrity. Attempting to execute review actions (like `ReplyComment`) on non-existent or fake IDs immediately raises a `BatchValidationError` rather than failing silently.

### 7. MCP Apps & UI Rendering
*   **Custom HTML Apps**: We use FastMCP's `AppConfig(resource_uri="ui://...")` to serve custom HTML/CSS interfaces for complex tools (e.g., `validate_documents`). We maintain full control over the markup.
*   **Vanilla JS**: We avoid external untested JS libraries to bypass CSP restrictions and ensure offline reliability. The iframe client uses a minimal `window.postMessage` JSON-RPC implementation to complete the Host handshake (`ui/initialize` -> `ui/notifications/initialized`) and receive payloads (`ui/notifications/tool-result`).
*   **Dynamic Resizing**: HTML resources must include a `ResizeObserver` that emits `ui/notifications/size-changed` messages to the Host, allowing the iframe to expand seamlessly as content is injected.
*   **Dual Payloads**: Tools utilizing UIs return `ToolResult(content=..., structured_content={"html": ...})`. This ensures the LLM receives pure Markdown to reason about, while the human user sees the styled HTML.

### 8. Document Sanitization & Part Ejection
*   **Deep Part Ejection**: When completely removing XML parts (e.g., Custom XML, Comments), deleting the elements is insufficient because `python-docx` will repackage empty XML files. We must explicitly sever relationships from `pkg.rels` and `part.rels`, and physically remove the part from `pkg._parts`.
*   **Mathematical Scrub Verification**: For metadata sanitization, we rely on `lxml` + XPath directly on the unzipped DOCX as the absolute source of truth. This strictly bypasses `python-docx` caching layers to mathematically guarantee artifacts are removed.
*   **Modern Comments Architecture**: Word's modern comments span four XML parts (`comments.xml`, `commentsExtended.xml`, `commentsIds.xml`, `commentsExtensible.xml`). The resolved status (`w15:done="1"`) is stored inside `commentsExtended.xml` and must be parsed and scrubbed from there.
*   **Empty Comment Part Lifecycle**: Empty comment XML parts are explicitly left intact rather than purged when all comments are removed, as dynamically mutating the `pkg.rels` matrix across different `python-docx` versions is volatile and can cause unrecoverable package corruption.
*   **Multi-Author Sanitization Awareness**: When executing a full document sanitization with auto-acceptance (`accept_all=True`), if multiple distinct authors are detected in pending track changes, a high-visibility warning is injected into the report to alert the user of potential 'silent smuggles'.
*   **Proxy Class OPC Binding**: When modifying `python-docx` XML parts that have native proxy classes (like `XmlPart` for Headers/Footers), we must re-bind `part._element = part._adeu_element` to ensure successful serialization on save.

### 9. Live MS Word Interop (Windows COM)
*   **Platform Safety**: All live Word tools (`live_word.py`) depend on `pywin32` and are conditionally registered via `sys.platform == 'win32'`.
*   **COM Apartment Lifecycle**: Microsoft Office COM objects are strictly Single-Threaded Apartment (STA). Because FastMCP and `pytest` hold proxy frames unpredictably, we **intentionally omit** `pythoncom.CoUninitialize()` and `app.Quit()` during test teardown. We let the OS/Python GC handle teardown naturally to prevent fatal RPC/Access Violations (`0x800706be`).
*   **Index Drift Mitigation**:
    *   **Extraction Parity**: Active COM extraction uses an *event-based string builder* (sorting events by length and type) to inject CriticMarkup tags safely. This handles infinitely nested/overlapping annotations (e.g., comments wrapping redlines) without string offset drift.
    *   **Pre-Resolution**: Modifying text natively adds Revisions, shifting `doc.Revisions` indices. We pre-resolve and cache all target COM objects *before* applying a batch of `DocumentChange` operations so Accept/Reject actions target the correct revisions.
    *   **Minimal-Diff Replacements**: Live Word COM replacements must mathematically trim common context (`trim_common_context`) from the target string's prefix and suffix before executing the COM replacement. Replacing the entire target string wholesale creates bloat and destroys adjacent comment anchors.
*   **Comment Bounds**: We strictly use `Comment.Scope` (the highlighted text), not `Comment.Reference` (the 0-length anchor), to accurately extract target strings for Comment annotations.
*   **Identity Spoofing & Deadlocks**: Tools temporarily hijack `Word.Application.UserName` and toggle `doc.TrackRevisions` to apply tracked changes cleanly as the Agent. *Constraint*: Modern M365 enforces logged-in MS Account identities on Comments. Attempting to spoof comment authors via `app.Options.UseLocalUserInfo` causes fatal STA thread deadlocks. Live comments will natively show the local user's real name. Live COM batch executions will natively surface a warning when the `author_name` is overridden by the host OS M365 identity to maintain predictable audit trails.

### 10. COM vs XML Impedance Mismatches
Achieving 100% CriticMarkup extraction parity between Live COM and Disk XML requires bridging deep structural differences:
*   **State Machine Parity**: Both engines MUST feed into the exact same event-driven state machine (`DocxEvent` accumulation -> `_get_wrappers` -> `_build_merged_meta_block`) to ensure identical tag ordering and bubble grouping.
*   **Formatting (Explicit vs Inherited)**: Disk XML evaluates explicit `<w:b/>` tags. Word COM's `rng.Find.Font.Bold` evaluates WYSIWYG bold (including inherited styles like Headings). Live COM must explicitly cross-check `rng.Style.Font.Bold` to avoid double-styling markdown markers (`**`) on inherited runs.
*   **Table Rendering & COM Offset Drift**: Word COM injects hidden structural characters (`\r\x07`) at cell boundaries, breaking Python string indices. Solution: Decouple structural markdown extraction (`|` for cells) from native COM execution, using exact index mapping arrays paired with `rng.Find` to securely bypass COM index drift.
*   **Ephemeral Session IDs**: Word natively assigns `w:id="0"` to all unsaved revisions/comments in live memory, randomly assigning persistent IDs during a Save. **IDs are session-bound.** Agents must treat Save/Reload boundaries as a state wipe and re-index the document IDs afterward.
*   **Destructive Native Edits (Comment Rescue)**: Assigning `Range.Text` in Live Word natively destroys any comments anchored to that text. Batch processors must explicitly cache, rescue, and re-anchor comments during string replacements.
*   **SmartSelection & Anchor Bleed**: Microsoft Word's `SmartSelection` natively snaps comment anchors leftward across spaces into preceding un-tracked sentences. To mathematically isolate anchors during structured multi-paragraph replacements, we temporarily disable `app.Options.SmartSelection`, inject an un-tracked "Sacrificial 'X'" character, attach the comment, and un-track-delete the 'X' to perfectly collapse the anchor.
*   **Pure Comment Redline Prevention**: If an agent requests a pure comment (`target_text == new_text`), executing a `.Text` replacement natively forces Word to generate spurious `<w:del>` and `<w:ins>` pairs. We must explicitly short-circuit and attach the comment directly without modifying the text to prevent document timeline pollution.
*   **Structured Insertions (Reverse Sandwich Algorithm)**: Word natively corrupts document structure if a tracked deletion precedes a new tracked paragraph break (`\r`), physically pushing the deletion into the next paragraph. To safely insert multi-paragraph replacements, we use a "Reverse Sandwich": insert Line 1 *before* the target, insert remaining lines *after*, and execute `.Delete()` on the target *last*.
*   **COM Comment Truncation Limit**: Microsoft Word's COM API (`doc.Comments.Add`) actively refuses to span a range containing both tracked deletions and tracked paragraph breaks. When executing multi-paragraph replacements, comments must be strictly anchored to the first inserted line (`Line 1`) to guarantee survival and visibility.
*   **Empty Runs & Timestamps**: Both engines must explicitly skip empty runs to synchronize lookahead bubble grouping. Both must emit full ISO-8601 timestamps without truncation to preserve chronological signals.
*   **Tracked Formatting Fragmentation**: Word natively splits a single tracked revision (`<w:ins>`) into multiple contiguous elements if partial formatting (like bold) is applied mid-revision. The ingestion state machine explicitly ignores pure state transition boundaries (like `ins_end`) when building CriticMarkup to seamlessly coalesce these fragments back into a single unified tag.

### 11. Redline Engine Execution Model (Performance & Safety)
*   **Pre-Resolution & Backwards-Sweep**: To avoid O(N²) scaling on large documents, all text edits are mapped against the *initial* document state to cache their physical offsets before any DOM mutations occur. Edits are then sorted in reverse order and applied bottom-up in a single O(N) sweep. This completely eliminates index drift and bypasses rebuilding the Virtual DOM map mid-batch. (Note: Because of this reverse execution, bottom-most edits receive lower sequential IDs like `Chg:1`).
*   **Namespace Injection & Serialization Safety**: Custom namespaces (e.g., `xmlns:w16du`) are injected directly into the raw XML byte stream at the document root upon load to prevent `lxml` from generating `ns0` alias artifacts that corrupt downstream processors. Crucially, we bypass `python-docx`'s `serialize_for_reading()` which forces destructive pretty-printing. We use raw `lxml.etree` with `pretty_print=False` and `remove_blank_text=False` to strictly preserve Microsoft Word's original whitespace structure and prevent massive, noisy diffs.
*   **Formatting Inheritance & Optimal Coalescing**: When text is inserted or replaced inside a styled span (e.g., bold), the new text natively inherits the context's styling (`suppress_inherited=False`) to prevent visual data loss. The engine's run coalescer then merges the matching runs to produce optimal, single-run output for whole-span replacements.
*   **Modification Comment Anchoring**: When a single edit causes a deletion and an insertion (`w:del` followed by `w:ins`), comments spanning the modification are explicitly anchored from the start of the `del` element to the end of the `ins` element to successfully encapsulate the full atomic revision.
*   **Nested Redline Strict Refusal**: Edits that target text strictly inside an active `<w:ins>` authored by a *different* user are explicitly rejected (`BatchValidationError`) to prevent confusing nested redline fragmentation.
*   **Paragraph Break Tracking**: When multi-paragraph text is inserted (`\n\n`), the engine explicitly injects an `<w:ins>` marker inside the `<w:pPr><w:rPr>` of the newly created paragraph, ensuring MS Word natively tracks the paragraph break itself.
*   **Multi-Paragraph Comment Anchoring (Disk)**: When a text replacement spans multiple paragraphs, the engine explicitly anchors the start of the comment to the first paragraph and the end of the comment to the last inserted paragraph to ensure survival and proper rendering.
*   **Diff Hunk Coalescing**: To prevent redline fragmentation, adjacent textual diff hunks separated by short runs of stable tokens (≤ 4 words) within the same paragraph are mathematically coalesced into a single unified edit hunk.
*   **Contiguous Orphan Comment Sweep**: When accepting/rejecting changes, comment anchor cleanup (`w:commentRangeStart/End`) must sweep across the entire contiguous block of adjacent redline tags (`w:ins`/`w:del`) to prevent orphaned anchors from leaking into the document body.

### 12. FastMCP Concurrency & Tooling
*   **Event Loop Blocking**: Any heavy, synchronous CPU or disk-bound tasks (e.g., `sanitize_docx`, or heavy batch processing) called from an async FastMCP tool endpoint MUST be wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread()`. This prevents the `asyncio` event loop from freezing and dropping MCP client heartbeats.
*   **Kwargs in to_thread**: When dispatching functions via `asyncio.to_thread` that expect keyword-only arguments, arguments must be explicitly passed as keyword arguments to prevent `TypeError: takes X positional arguments` errors.
*   **Testing Tools**: FastMCP's `@tool` decorator heavily modifies function metadata. When asserting against an MCP tool's prompt or docstring in tests, prefer `inspect.getsource(func)` or `getattr(func, "description", "")` rather than `func.__doc__`.

### 13. Domain Gaps & Projection Syntax (Semantic Markdown)
To solve domain visibility gaps without adding new MCP tools, `read_docx` projects a strictly defined semantic dialect of Markdown:
*   **Italics Strictness**: Adeu strictly uses `_italic_`. The `*italic*` syntax is explicitly parsed as literal text.
*   **Footnotes/Endnotes**: Projected inline as `[^fn-{w:id}]` (using stable OOXML IDs, not display numbers) and appended at the bottom. Fully bi-directional. Editing them natively updates `footnotes.xml`. *Constraint*: Generic XML parts lack `get_style()`, so `_get_paragraph_style_safe` gracefully handles missing formatting attributes.
*   **Bi-directional Links**: `[text](url)`. Editing the text applies tracked changes. Editing the URL executes a silent `URL_RETARGET` operation in `_rels` (no redlines emitted).
*   **Cross-References**: Projected as `[~text~](#_Ref)`. The `[~...~]` wrapper indicates computed/read-only text. Attempting to modify the display text or hash via `ModifyText` is strictly rejected (`BatchValidationError`) to prevent dependency corruption.
*   **Internal Anchors**: Structural bookmarks project inline as `{#_BookmarkName}`. Modifying or fabricating this syntax throws a `BatchValidationError` (Strict Refusal) as text-replacement cannot safely resolve these structural nodes.
*   **Structural Appendix & Boundary Validation**: Structural XML (Bookmarks, TOC boundaries) is appended to the bottom behind a `<!-- READONLY_BOUNDARY_START -->` marker. The boundary validator strictly uses *resolved physical indices* (`find_all_match_indices`) rather than blind string-matching, safely allowing body edits that coincidentally share text with the appendix.
*   **Defined Terms & Semantic Diagnostics**: We project a "Symbol Table" of terms and "Semantic Diagnostics" (Unresolved, Unused, Duplicate, Typo warnings) in the Appendix.
    *   *Language-Agnostic Extraction*: Terms are extracted structurally via typography (leading/inline quotes), not brittle English regexes. Terms must be used ≥1 time to be included.
    *   *High-Signal Diagnostics*: Typo candidates are grouped by target term. False positives are pruned via stop-word filtering, singular/plural exclusion, and a strict rule for short acronyms (≤5 chars: max edit distance of 1 and identical first letter).

### 14. TypeScript / Node.js Engine Constraints
*   **DOM Simulation**: `python-docx` is emulated via `jszip` and `@xmldom/xmldom`. Strict shim functions (`findChild`, `findAllDescendants`) simulate `lxml`'s direct-child vs recursive search to prevent catastrophic DOM traversal mismatches.
*   **Regex Engine Limits**: JS regex does not support Python's atomic grouping `(?>...)`. Catastrophic backtracking in fuzzy matchers is prevented using mathematically equivalent character classes (e.g., `[*_]*`).
*   **Regex Compatibility (ES2022)**: We strictly target ES2022 to guarantee support for regex lookbehinds (`(?<!...)`), which are heavily utilized to cleanly port Python's semantic domain extraction logic.
*   **Whitespace Evaluation**: Python's `isspace()` checks the whole string, whereas JS requires explicit regex anchors (`/^\s+$/`) to prevent aggressive context-trimming bugs.
*   **diff-match-patch Volatility**: Inside the core Redline Engine, `diff_charsToLines_` is bypassed using manual array-mapping loops to prevent minifier inconsistencies. However, the external Diff Tool (`diff.ts`) explicitly utilizes `diff_linesToChars_` to cleanly generate standardized Unified Diff strings without character-level fragmentation.
*   **Package Mutation Parity**: Emulating `python-docx`'s save flow requires manually serializing mutated `@xmldom/xmldom` elements via `XMLSerializer` and dynamically updating `[Content_Types].xml` and `.rels` files inside `JSZip` to prevent OPC package corruption.
*   **Explicit Relationship Mapping & Strict Namespaces**: In pure JS (`@xmldom` + `jszip`), we cannot rely on implicit `python-docx` relationship abstractions. External targets (like Hyperlinks) require explicitly fetching/creating the target `_rels/document.xml.rels` file and manually injecting the `<Relationship>` node. Crucially, these nodes MUST be created with explicit namespace awareness (`createElementNS`), or `XMLSerializer` will silently drop them during package serialization.
*   **Pure-TS Bounded Levenshtein**: Node.js MCP environments cannot use C-bindings (like `rapidfuzz`). We implement a highly optimized, pure-TS Bounded Levenshtein algorithm (`max_dist = 2`) directly in the structural appendix generator to evaluate typographical errors without blocking the V8 event loop on large documents.
*   **Test Utilities**: Because JS lacks `python-docx`'s in-memory factory methods, `test-utils.ts` shims document building by dynamically wiping and mutating an empty `initial.docx` fixture with raw OOXML node injection.
*   **Zero-Dependency Finalization**: The Node.js `.mcpb` bundle strictly omits PDF export (`docx2pdf`/LibreOffice) and AES encryption (`msoffcrypto-tool`) capabilities from the `finalize_document` tool to strictly maintain its zero-dependency architecture.
*   **Native OOXML Locking**: Document protection is achieved natively by injecting `<w:documentProtection w:edit="readOnly" w:enforcement="1"/>` directly into `word/settings.xml` using `@xmldom/xmldom`.
*   **XML Serialization Quirks**: Emptying elements in `@xmldom/xmldom` (`el.textContent = ""`) serializes them as self-closing tags (e.g., `<Template/>` instead of `<Template></Template>`), requiring mathematically equivalent but structurally loose string assertions in unit tests.

## Developer Workflows

### Testing
*   **Regression Pattern**: Create `tests/test_repro_[issue].py` to isolate bugs before fixing.
*   **Golden Files**: `tests/fixtures/golden.docx` is the source of truth for Modern Comments (Word 2021+) XML structure.

### Deployment
*   **Versioning**: Semantic versioning in `pyproject.toml`. `src/adeu/__init__.py` dynamically loads this via `importlib.metadata`.
*   **Dependencies**: Uses `uv` (PEP 621 standard) with `hatchling` as the build backend. `python-docx` is patched at runtime in `comments.py` to support Modern Comments namespaces (`w16cid`, `w15`).

### Agent Integration Testing
*   To test changes to the MCP server without publishing to PyPI, use `uv run adeu init --local`.
*   This configures Claude Desktop to execute the server from the current local source (`sys.executable` + `cwd`), bypassing `uvx`.
